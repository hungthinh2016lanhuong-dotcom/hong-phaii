        •  You must accept that you won’t understand everything you read in a
story. This is probably the most important point of all! Always remember
that it is completely normal that you do not understand all the words or
sentences. It doesn’t mean that your language level is flawed or that you
are not doing well. It means you’re engaged in the process of learning.
So, what should you do when you don’t understand a word? Here are a
few steps:
1. Look at the word and see if it is familiar in any way. Remember to look
for vocabulary elements from your first language that may be familiar.
Take a guess – you might surprise yourself!
2. Re-read the sentence that contains the unknown word several times. Use
the context of that sentence, and the rest of the story, to try to guess what
the unknown word might mean.
3. Think about whether or not the word might be a different form of a word
you know. For example, you might encounter a verb that you know, but it
has been conjugated in a different or unfamiliar way:
go
went
have gone
You may not be familiar with the particular form used, but ask yourself:
Can I still understand the gist of what’s going on? Usually, if you have
managed to recognize the main verb, that is enough. Instead of getting
frustrated, simply notice how the verb is being used, and carry on
reading. Recognizing different forms of words will come intuitively over
time.
